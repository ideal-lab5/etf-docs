# Getting Started

The **timelock auction** is a proof-of-concept of our timelock encryption library. It uses timelock encryption to seal bids in a second-price sealed bid auction for ERC721 tokens. In this style of auction, the highest bidder only pays the amount bid by the second highest bidder, like in the image below:
