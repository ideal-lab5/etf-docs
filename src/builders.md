# Builders

A guide for building dapps on top of the etf network.

- [ETF-SDK](./etf_sdk.md): A no-std, wasm-compatible rust library containing crypto primitives
- [etf.js](./etf_js.md): A typescript library and wrapper around the etf-sdk wasm build. It enables interaction with the ETF Network as well as timelock encryption/decryption within the browser.
- [Smart Contracts](./contracts.md): The ETF Network supports smart contracts, as well as exposes a custom chain extension for verifying the existence of slot secrets within contracts.
