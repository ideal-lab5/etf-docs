# ETF Network

The Etf Network is a [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate.git)-based blockchain that utilizes identity-based encryption and zero knowledge proofs to enable "encryption to the future." Encryption to the future, similar in idea to timelock encryption, uses a slot-based consensus system as a reference clock to which messages can be encrypted. The initial implementation uses a fork of Aura to implement a proof-of-authority version of EtF. The network acts as a cryptographic primitive enabling encryption to the future and decryption from the past. EtF Network can unlock innovative use cases, such as MEV protection, trustless MPC protocols (e.g. atomic asset swaps, filesystems) and keyless encryption tools.
